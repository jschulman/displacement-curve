## Signal 4: AI Revenue Reporting

**Source:** SEC EDGAR, Earnings Transcripts
**Update Cadence:** Quarterly (following earnings releases)

### Firms Tracked

| Ticker | Firm | Sector |
|--------|------|--------|
| ACN | Accenture | IT Consulting |
| CTSH | Cognizant | IT Consulting |
| INFY | Infosys | IT Consulting |
| WIT | Wipro | IT Consulting |
| EPAM | EPAM Systems | IT Consulting |
| GLOB | Globant | IT Consulting |
| IT | Gartner | Advisory |
| BAH | Booz Allen Hamilton | Government Consulting |

### The Accenture Normalization Problem

Accenture dominates reported "AI revenue" in this cohort and frequently relabels existing digital/cloud services as AI-enabled. This creates a measurement challenge: are firms genuinely growing AI revenue, or relabeling existing work? We address this with the Relabeling Index.

### Relabeling Index

A ratio comparing a firm's reported AI revenue growth rate to its total revenue growth rate. An index of 1.0 means AI revenue grows at the same rate as total revenue (no signal). Values above 1.5 suggest genuine AI-specific growth. Values below 1.0 suggest relabeling may exceed actual new work.

### Metrics

- **AI Revenue ($M):** Total AI-attributed revenue across tracked firms
- **AI Revenue %:** AI revenue as a percentage of total revenue
- **Revenue Per Employee ($K):** Quarterly revenue divided by headcount (efficiency proxy)
- **Relabeling Index:** Ratio of AI rev growth to total rev growth

### Interpretation

Rising AI revenue alongside flat or declining headcount is the core displacement signal. The relabeling index helps distinguish genuine AI-driven efficiency from marketing rebranding.

## Signal 5: SEC Workforce Disclosures

**Source:** SEC EDGAR 10-K Annual Reports, Item 1 (Human Capital)
**Update Cadence:** Quarterly (following 10-K/10-Q filings)

### Firms Tracked

| Ticker | Firm | Sector |
|--------|------|--------|
| ACN | Accenture | IT Consulting |
| CTSH | Cognizant | IT Consulting |
| INFY | Infosys | IT Consulting |
| WIT | Wipro | IT Consulting |
| EPAM | EPAM Systems | IT Consulting |
| GLOB | Globant | IT Consulting |
| IT | Gartner | Advisory |
| BAH | Booz Allen Hamilton | Government Consulting |
| KFRC | Kforce | Staffing |
| RHI | Robert Half | Staffing |
| MAN | ManpowerGroup | Staffing |

### Metrics

- **Headcount:** Total reported employees
- **YoY Change:** Year-over-year headcount change (%)
- **Contractor %:** Estimated contractor/contingent workforce as percentage of total
- **Revenue Per Employee ($K):** Annual revenue divided by headcount

### Interpretation

SEC filings provide the most reliable headcount data. Declining headcount at IT services firms while revenue grows indicates productivity gains (potentially AI-driven). Staffing firms (KFRC, RHI, MAN) serve as a canary — declining placements suggest reduced demand for human labor.

### Staffing Canary Status

As of May 2026, the staffing-firm canary panels (KFRC, RHI, MAN) carry empty
`annual` arrays in `data/sec/processed/workforce.json`. The 10-K collector has
not yet been pointed at those tickers. Until the canary is populated, treat
its absence as "no signal," not "no displacement" — the slot is reserved, not
disproved.

## Signal 5b: Corporate AI Layoff Attribution

**Source:** Public layoff announcements, 10-Q filings, post-announcement
financial disclosures.
**Update Cadence:** Event-driven.

### Why This Exists

Through 2025-2026, "AI" has become a load-bearing word in layoff press
releases. A December 2025 survey of 1,000 hiring managers found 59% admit they
emphasize AI in layoff announcements because it "plays better with
stakeholders" than admitting weak demand or over-hiring. Oxford Economics has
characterized the pattern as "convenient corporate fiction." Treating every
AI-attributed layoff as a displacement data point would import that
narrative noise directly into the composite.

This signal does not feed the composite. It flags layoff events on the
timeline with an **attribution quality** label, so readers can distinguish
narrative-led announcements from those corroborated by financial signals.

### Attribution Quality Categories

| Quality | Definition | Treatment |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| `validated` | AI cited AND ≥2 of: rising revenue per remaining employee, measurable internal AI usage data, prior AI-tied product disclosures in 10-Q, stock-price impact suggesting the market took it as real | Annotated on the curve; counts toward "displacement" reading |
| `marketing` | AI cited primarily in CEO memo / press release without corroborating financial disclosure | Annotated on the curve as a separate marker; does not count toward displacement reading |
| `mixed` | Some corroboration but layoff also overlaps with broader restructuring, sector headwinds, or a missed quarter | Annotated; treated as ambiguous |

### Worked Examples

**Coinbase — 2026-05-05 — `marketing`.** 700 layoffs (~14% of workforce).
CEO Brian Armstrong's 6:55 AM email framed the cut as becoming "lean, fast,
and AI-native" and was paired with a "tiny teams" / player-coach
restructuring. Crypto-sector headwinds and prior cost-cutting cycles at
Coinbase make AI an over-determined explanation. Scale AI's Jason Droege and
other observers explicitly flagged it as an "AI excuse" framing. No
disclosed internal AI usage metrics tied to the affected roles.

**Cloudflare — 2026-05-07/08 — `validated`.** 1,100 layoffs (~20% of
workforce); first mass layoff in the company's 16-year history.
Corroborating signals: (a) disclosed >600% increase in internal AI usage in
the prior three months with role-level mapping ("roles AI agents are already
performing"); (b) record-high revenue announced in the same earnings call,
ruling out demand collapse as the driver; (c) ~24% stock drop on the news,
indicating the market read the restructuring as substantive rather than
cosmetic; (d) CEO's stated expectation that headcount returns to growth in
2027 — consistent with a productivity step-change, not a demand cut.

### Method

Each layoff event is recorded in the `events` array of
`data/composite/displacement_index.json` with:

```
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM",
  "label": "<Company> -N (X%) ...",
  "type": "layoff",
  "attribution_quality": "validated" | "marketing" | "mixed"
}
```

### Interpretation

A rising count of `validated` layoffs at firms with **growing** revenue is
the cleanest direct evidence of displacement (productivity gain absorbed by
headcount reduction rather than reinvested in hiring). A rising count of
`marketing` layoffs is a signal about narrative, not labor — useful context
for why the discourse runs ahead of the BLS prints, but not evidence of
displacement on its own.

## Signal 6: VC Funding in AI Services

**Source:** SEC Form D Filings, Crunchbase, PitchBook
**Update Cadence:** Quarterly

### What It Measures

Capital flows into AI-native competitors to traditional professional services firms. Rising VC investment in AI-native audit, legal, consulting, compliance, and staffing startups signals investor conviction that these markets are ripe for disruption.

### Categories Tracked

| Category Key | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ai_audit | AI-Native Audit/Accounting startups |
| ai_legal | AI Legal Services startups |
| ai_consulting | AI Consulting/Strategy startups |
| ai_compliance | AI Compliance/Regulatory startups |
| ai_staffing | AI-Native Staffing startups |
| horizontal_ai | Horizontal AI Agents (cross-sector) |

### Metrics

- **Total Funding ($M):** Aggregate quarterly funding across all tracked categories
- **Deal Count:** Number of funding rounds per quarter
- **Cumulative Funding ($M):** Running total of all capital deployed
- **Category Breakdown:** Funding by vertical (stacked bar chart)

### Interpretation

Accelerating VC investment in AI-native professional services companies indicates smart money believes displacement is imminent. The category breakdown reveals which professional services verticals are attracting the most disruptive investment.

## Signal 7: Job Posting Trends

**Source:** Indeed Hiring Lab, LinkedIn Economic Graph
**Update Cadence:** Monthly

### What It Measures

Structural shifts in hiring patterns across professional services. Tracks the ratio of AI-related job postings to traditional role postings, revealing whether firms are replacing traditional hiring with AI-focused roles.

### Firms Tracked

| Ticker | Firm | Sector |
|--------|------|--------|
| ACN | Accenture | IT Consulting |
| CTSH | Cognizant | IT Consulting |
| INFY | Infosys | IT Consulting |
| WIT | Wipro | IT Consulting |
| EPAM | EPAM Systems | IT Consulting |
| GLOB | Globant | IT Consulting |
| IT | Gartner | Advisory |
| BAH | Booz Allen Hamilton | Government Consulting |

### Metrics

- **AI Postings %:** Percentage of job postings requiring AI/ML skills
- **Traditional Postings %:** Percentage of traditional (non-AI) role postings
- **AI-to-Traditional Ratio:** Direct ratio of AI to traditional postings (key displacement indicator)
- **Total Postings Index:** Overall posting volume indexed to baseline

### Interpretation

A rising AI-to-traditional ratio indicates firms are structurally shifting their workforce composition toward AI skills. When AI postings rise while traditional postings decline, it signals active displacement of traditional roles rather than net new hiring.

## Signal 8: Regulatory Guidance Cadence

**Source:** Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, CFPB, SEC, EU AI Act Framework, NIST AI RMF
**Update Cadence:** Quarterly

### Regulators Tracked

| Key | Regulator | Jurisdiction |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| fed | Federal Reserve | US |
| occ | Office of the Comptroller of the Currency | US |
| fdic | Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation | US |
| cfpb | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | US |
| sec | Securities and Exchange Commission | US |
| eu | EU AI Act | EU |
| nist | National Institute of Standards and Technology | US |

### Metrics

- **Document Count:** Total AI-related guidance documents issued per quarter per regulator
- **Enforcement Count:** Enforcement actions referencing AI per quarter
- **Guidance Count:** Non-enforcement guidance (frameworks, best practices, comment requests)
- **Cumulative Documents:** Running total across all regulators

### Interpretation

Accelerating regulatory output signals that AI displacement has become a policy concern. Early-stage regulatory activity (guidance, frameworks) suggests awareness. Enforcement actions indicate the regulatory posture is shifting from observation to intervention. A rapid increase in cumulative documents marks the transition from a permissive to a structured regulatory environment.

## Composite Displacement Index

The Composite Displacement Index synthesizes all eight signals into a single score (0-100) indicating where professional services stand on the displacement curve.

### Weights

| Signal | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Professional Services Employment | 0.25 | The definitive lagging indicator of displacement |
| Revenue Per Employee | 0.20 | Efficiency gains preceding headcount reduction |
| VC Funding: AI Services | 0.15 | Capital conviction in AI-native replacements |
| AI vs Traditional Hiring | 0.15 | Real-time labor market composition shift |
| AI Search Interest | 0.10 | Cultural awareness and behavioral intent |
| Open Source AI Activity | 0.10 | Developer tooling leading commercial products |
| Regulatory Guidance | 0.05 | Policy response to displacement concerns |

### Normalization

Each signal is normalized to a 0-100 scale relative to its observed range over the tracking period. This ensures signals with different units (employment in thousands, funding in millions, ratios) are comparable.

### Phase Ranges

| Score Range | Phase | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 0-25 | Pre-disruption | AI is a topic, not a force. Business as usual. |
| 26-50 | Productivity | AI is making firms more efficient. Employment stable or growing. |
| 51-75 | Erosion | Revenue per employee diverging from headcount. Job mix shifting. |
| 76-100 | Displacement | Employment declining. Funding pouring into replacements. |

### Caveats

- The composite index is a simplification. It compresses eight distinct signals into a single number.
- Weight assignments are based on editorial judgment, not statistical optimization.
- Phase boundaries are fixed thresholds, not data-driven breakpoints.
- The index is designed for directional insight, not precision. A score of 42 vs 44 is noise. A score of 25 vs 50 is signal.
